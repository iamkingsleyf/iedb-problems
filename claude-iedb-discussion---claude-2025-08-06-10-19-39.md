## 🧑 Human

THE IEDB MUST BE THE TITLE OF THIS CHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO START.

Can we begin?? Yes or No only

---

## 🧑 Human

I want to build IEDB for Inquiral.com using TMDB api.

However the prompt and instructions are incomplete, missing critical information because it’s kinda being written for human instead of CURSOR/TRAE AI… you know you on these apps.

So if I upload my conversations from the previous chats and also the prompts/instructions do you think you can 1. Find out the missing informations, features that were supposed to be included? You will display it for me to confirm 
1. Tailor it for TRAE/CURSOR AI? Without messing it up in this chat?AGAIN?
2. And between TRAE and Cursor which do you recommend for me? Remember cursor website doesn’t open in Nigeria so I have to use vpn. And I just want to build tools and stuffs I need for my web publishing business at kraftysprouts.com

1. Analyze your previous conversations - I'll review the uploaded chats to identify missing information, incomplete features, and gaps in the IEDB project requirements
2. Tailor prompts for AI coding assistants - I'll rewrite the instructions specifically for TRAE/Cursor AI, making them more structured and comprehensive
3. TRAE vs Cursor recommendation - Given that Cursor requires VPN access in Nigeria and you're focused on building practical tools for your web publishing business, I'd lean toward recommending TRAE for better accessibility and potentially smoother workflow.

- Extract all the intended features and requirements
- Identify what's missing or incomplete
- Present a clear summary for your confirmation
- Create properly structured AI-assistant prompts
- Give you a detailed TRAE vs Cursor comparison for your specific use case

## Key Context from Document 1:

### 🎯 Project Details:

- Plugin Name: IEDB (Inquiral Entertainment Database)
- Purpose: WordPress plugin for movies, TV shows, cast/crew with TMDB API
- Author: Krafty Sprouts Media, LLC ( https://kraftysprouts.com )
- Target: Entertainment web publishing business

### 🔍 Issues Identified:

1. Missing RSS Enhancement Details - Admin toggles, rich metadata, genre-specific feeds
2. Media Library Integration - All images go to WordPress Media Library (NOT external storage/folders)
3. Navigation Integration - Three admin options for menu integration
4. Coming Soon Content Logic - Publish before release dates with countdown timers
5. Multi-Source Ratings - TMDB, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic with individual toggles
6. Database Architecture Decision - You wanted CUSTOM TABLES instead of WordPress default tables

### 🗄️ Database Structure Decision:

- Your Choice: Custom IEDB tables (iedb_movies, iedb_tv_shows, iedb_people, etc.)
- Reasoning: Better performance, cleaner structure, scalability for entertainment data

### 📝 Document Issues:

- The artifact kept breaking and showing as text instead of markdown
- Instructions were written for human developers instead of Cursor AI
- Missing comprehensive database schema and file structure

1. Identify all missing features from both conversations
2. Create a complete Cursor AI-optimized brief
3. Recommend TRAE vs Cursor for your Nigeria-based workflow
4. Ensure nothing gets lost this time

## 🧑 Human
